## Properties

All events accept these optional properties. Never add properties outside this list.

```ts
{
  source?: 'onboarding' | 'profile' | 'dates_page'
  status_type?: 'work_permit' | 'study_permit' | 'pr' | 'visitor' | 'unknown'
  goal?: 'deadlines' | 'pr_planning' | 'citizenship' | 'pr_residency' | 'explore'
  authenticated?: boolean
  step?: 'goal' | 'location' | 'status' | 'key_date' | 'save_plan'
  reminder_channel?: 'email'
}
```

`status_type` and `goal` use safe buckets — never raw permit types or dates.

## The 5 PostHog dashboards to build

### 1. Onboarding funnel

Steps: `onboarding_started → onboarding_goal_selected → onboarding_status_selected → onboarding_key_date_added → onboarding_completed → account_created`

`onboarding_completed` fires when the user clicks "Save my plan with email" on the plan preview screen — meaning they committed to the path. `account_created` fires only after Supabase signup succeeds. The gap between the two is email/password friction.

**Primary question:** Of everyone who starts onboarding, what % saves one key date?
**Target:** 55% select a goal, 40% add a key date, 35% reach `onboarding_completed`.

### 2. Core value funnel (activation)

Steps: `account_created → deadline_added → reminders_enabled → travel_log_added → app_opened (again)`

**Primary question:** What % of new accounts add one deadline in their first session?
**Target:** 60%+.

### 3. Day-7 retention

First event: `account_created`. Return event: `app_opened` or `dashboard_viewed`. Window: day 7.

**Primary question:** Which first action (added deadline / added travel / viewed tracker) best predicts day-7 return?

### 4. Feature adoption

Weekly breakdown of % of active users who:
- Added at least one deadline
- Enabled reminders
- Added travel history
- Opened citizenship tracker
- Opened PR residency tracker
- Updated a date (signals trust as source of truth)

### 5. Drop-off by onboarding step

Use `step` property on `onboarding_goal_selected`, `onboarding_location_selected`, `onboarding_status_selected`, `onboarding_key_date_added` to build a step-by-step funnel and identify where users leave.
